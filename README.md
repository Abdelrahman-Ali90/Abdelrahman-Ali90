# ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;Hi there

I'm a software developer based in New Zealand. I enjoy coding open-source projects that solve unique problems. I love combining my hobbies like 3D printing, coding and building various projects with RaspberryPi's or Arduino. Slightly obsessed with Home Automation and Home Labs. You can find me on Twitter [@Sudo_Overflow](https://twitter.com/sudo_overflow). Feel free to tweet me any time. You can also check out my website [Cyris.io](https://Cyris.io) for my blog and more.
